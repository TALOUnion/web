              unionize. Companies like Amazon, Starbucks, and Target have

              <span style="text-decoration: underline">Early Spring 2022:</span>
              During TA camp in January, a handful of TAs began to meet and
              discuss their dissatisfaction with their working conditions. To
              validate their experiences, they sought second opinions from
              coworkers that they knew well in the department. After a few
              months of meeting and planning on their own, a group of these
              student workers (who later became &ldquo;the Working Group&rdquo;)
              collaborated to write an

              to the department administration asking for these issues to be
              addressed.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="text-decoration: underline">Mid Spring 2022:</span>
              Until the early summer, they met with department administrators in
              multiple sessions to discuss issues with working conditions and
              ask for change. As a direct result of the TAs taking action and
              standing together in solidarity, they were able to secure a ~22%
              pay raise, release a survey to TAs asking about their experiences,
              and update their job descriptions and important work documents,
              such as the TA missives.&nbsp;
            </p>

                >Late Spring/Summer 2022:</span
              >
              Progress stalled on important issues such as TA training,
              additional oversight, and professor accountability. Emboldened by
              the results of their collective action and the victories of other
              undergraduate workers across the country during the pandemic, the
              Working Group pursued training on how to have organizing 1-on-1
              conversations, which were then used to recruit more student
              workers. By the end of the summer, around 20 TAs formed an
              Organizing Committee (OC) to have 1-on-1 conversations with Fall
              2022 TAs throughout the Fall 2022 semester and organize for a
              union. Eventually, this group grew as large as 40 TAs.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="text-decoration: underline">Fall 2022:</span> The OC
              started mapping out the areas of TA student workers to gain an
              accurate count of how many employees there were in total. GLO
              organizers worked with the OC, helping to draft up a timeline for
              achieving a union within the semester, as well as helping to
              streamline and formalize assignments for the OC to have 1-on-1
              conversations to recruit more student workers into the union.
            </p>
            <p>
              The &gt;65% of TAs who signed union cards did so because an
              original group of TAs started having 1-on-1 conversations with
              each of them.

                bargain, and discuss the union with your co-workers without
                losing your job. If the university attempts to violate this

              <li>
                Your right to get re-hired by Brown is not legally protected.
                However, the power in numbers is on our side. We have over 65%
                of current TAs on board, and 50%&ndash;60% of TAs are re-hired

              International students have the same rights as US citizens to
              participate in union activity. Visa requirements in no way
              compromise your right to belong to a union that represents you in
              a US workplace. It is illegal for Brown to retaliate against any
              worker for protected activity, and union efforts fall into that
              protected category. Thousands of international student workers
              across the United States are members of labor unions at colleges
              like the University of California system, Columbia University, and
              more, and have been otherwise active in their unions for more than
              40 years. The international members of Columbia University&rsquo;s
              graduate students&rsquo; union even have their own

              That&rsquo;s not to mention the international graduate students
              who are a part of GLO at Brown who haven&rsquo;t had their visas
              threatened by the University on the grounds of their union
              activity.

            <p>
              All student employees, regardless of their immigration status,
              have the federally-protected rights to 1) engage in activity with
              their co-workers concerning their working conditions, 2) form a
              union, and 3) collectively bargain with their universities.

              The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) cannot ask
              you questions about your union membership or participation in
              lawful union activity. In addition, the Department of Homeland
              Security (DHS) recognized the importance of enforcing labor laws
              and signed an agreement with the Department of Labor (DOL) that
              states it
              <em

              It is your right to belong to a union and being a union member
              cannot and should not affect your visa application.

            <p>
              Political activities such as picketing, rallies, leafleting,
              demonstrations, etc., are forms of expression and free
              association, which are protected for foreigners in the U.S.
              (including foreign students with visas) as they are for U.S.
              nationals. It is against the law for your employer (the
              university) to retaliate against you for participating in these
              protected activities.
            </p>
            <p>
              All foreign students enjoy the same rights to freedom of
              expression and freedom of association as U.S. nationals. Federal
              law protects your right to join a union. The only relevant
              restriction on political activity by foreign students is that they
              cannot make financial contributions to political organizations in
              the United States.

              What&rsquo;s wrong with internal channels to create change, like
              speaking with our professors, department leadership, or UCS? Why
              do we need to be so extreme?
            </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                There is not currently an avenue for TAs to voice their concerns
                and represent themselves without facing potential employer
                backlash or increased tensions in their workplace/within their
                staff.&nbsp;
              </li>
              <li>
                While MTAs do their best to advocate for TAs, they are
                ultimately a small staff of 2-4 undergraduates themselves, and
                shouldn&rsquo;t shoulder the burden of advocating for a large
                group of diverse TAs.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              </li>
              <li>
                There is a breadth of issues that TA workers face, and a union
                provides workers with the legal means to tackle all the issues
                they face at the same time, not just issues related to pay.
              </li>
              <li>
                While UCS representatives speak frequently with administrators,
                UCS representatives often do not have any power beyond an
                advisory role to administrators. Beyond bringing issues up and
                advocating for them on the committees, UCS cannot compel
                administrators to do anything. By contrast, a union legally
                compels administrators to bargain with us.
              </li>
              <li>
                While our professors are sometimes sympathetic to our issues,
                they ultimately do not have enough control to make significant
                changes to the conditions of our work. But often, they are not
                sympathetic at all.&nbsp;

              Will being in a union and signing a new contract make our work
              more rigid? Does it mean we will be held to a higher standard?
            </h2>
            <p>
              No! There is nothing in the structure of a union that prevents
              union members from talking to their supervisors as they normally
              would. In fact, it is your supervisors who must understand that
              they can no longer talk to you with disrespect, gaslight you,
              ignore your problems, or threaten your job security in any way.
            </p>
            <p>
              As to the standards of your job, what is defined in the contract
              is ultimately decided by the workers &mdash; so the TAs will get
              to decide what kind of standards they should be held to!
            </p>
            <p>
              The idea that a union contract, which is collectively bargained by
              the workers, will somehow create standards that most workers
              cannot meet, is absurd and nonsensical.

                The university is able to spend more of its endowment than it
                currently does on pro-student, pro-worker, pro-community

                >. This massive sum increased by ~51.5% during 2021, meaning
                that our endowment returns have been immense. The University CAN
                afford paying students a living wage AND support financial aid
                fully at the same time.

                Forming this union will lay the material, organizing, and legal
                groundwork for expanding unionization across all sectors of
                workers on campus. This will ultimately support low-income
                students in a more meaningful way than any expansions of
                financial aid: especially as it gives all of us <em>power</em>,
                and we can demand fair pay for our work!
