              Brown University Undergraduate Teaching Assistants Are Unionizing
            </b>
          </p>
          <p><i>December 5, 2022</i></p>
          <p>
            Providence, RI - The undergraduate teaching assistants in the
            Department of Computer Science at Brown University have announced
            their decision to file for unionization with the National Labor
            Relations Board and are seeking voluntary recognition from Brown.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Over 65% of all TAs have signed union authorization cards, giving
            us a supermajority of support,” said Colton Rusch, an organizer with
            the group and a 7-semester TA. “Given the overwhelming support from
            TAs, we expect Brown to voluntarily recognize our right to organize
            and negotiate as workers. We call on them not to engage in any
            anti-union action.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The UTAs will be forming the Teaching Assistant Labor Organization
            (TALO) as a part of Brown’s Graduate Labor Organization (GLO) to
            improve working conditions and hold their employers accountable.
          </p>
          <p>
            The TAs are seeking higher wages, better working conditions, and a
            more inclusive and equitable workplace.
          </p>
          <p>
            “CS TAs at Brown are systematically exploited and underpaid,” said
            Harshini Venkatachalam, another organizer, a 6-semester TA. “While
            there are stated limits on TA working hours, a majority of the TAs
            we’ve surveyed report frequently working overtime. A majority also
            report having logged fewer hours than they’ve worked, often for fear
            of retaliation. Many TAs play the role of professors: writing
            handouts, rubrics, and lecture slides, and in some cases giving
            entire lectures. And we’re still paid less than TAs in many peer
            institutions such as Harvard and Yale.”
          </p>
          <p>
            As part of a union, the CS TAs will be able to negotiate directly
            with the university to secure higher wages and systems of
            accountability to ensure that TAs aren’t required to do unreasonable
            work or work excessive hours.

            Undergraduate workers at many of Brown’s peer institutions have
            recently formed unions. Last Spring, Wesleyan College

            a union of its undergraduate workers. Harvard’s undergraduate
