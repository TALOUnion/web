            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "<p>TALO grew out of discussions between CS TAs about our working conditions, and with the CS TA program being the system of undergraduate student employment most familiar to us as well as the largest and most visible TA program at Brown, we decided to start with just CS TAs.</p><p>An important part of a unionization effort is defining the &quot;bargaining unit&quot; — a group of employees with a clear and identifiable community of interests — in order to get the union recognized (voluntarily, by the employer, or more commonly, via an election facilitated by the National Labor Relations Board). We believe that the undergraduate TAs employed by the CS department form a bargaining unit on our own, since our community is large and has particular facets to the TA role that are different from other departments. If at this stage we were to declare our bargaining unit to be CS TAs as well as PHYS TAs and NEUR TAs, for instance, Brown would likely challenge our efforts and force us to include all TAs in our bargaining unit. They&#39;d likely say that CS, PHYS, and NEUR TAs aren&#39;t too different from ENGN TAs, or TAPS TAs, or APMA TAs, and so on, so all TAs should be included in the bargaining unit. This would complicate our efforts to organize our workforce because we have limited resources, and ultimately we&#39;re a grassroots campaign led by undergraduate CS TAs</p><p>However, forming this union will lay the material, organizing, and legal groundwork for expanding unionization across all sectors of student workers on campus. We can and will share our campaign infrastructure with other undergraduate workers on campus. In the future, we can incorporate other smaller bargaining units of undergraduate TAs (e.g., PHYS TAs) into our bargaining unit, and TALO can grow to become more representative of all undergraduate TAs at Brown.</p>"
