# Bargaining

TALO's Contract Proposal

Bargaining Tracker

## Bargaining Update [mm/dd/yy]

Bargaining a mature contract takes a long time. Because we would like to have some increased benefits in place by the Fall, we are working with admin to negotiate a smaller, One-Year Interim Agreement. We submitted our full proposal to admin on May 22, 2023. We are still waiting for their response.

Throughout the 2023-2024 academic year, we will re-engage in bargaining to bargain a full contract that, we hope, will be in effect for several years.

# General FAQ

<FAQCard question="What is a contract, and why do we need one?">
     A contract is a binding document that two or more parties agree to. So in our case, we are negotiating a contract between TALO, which represents CS TAs, and the Brown University administration.

    In short, admin can give us their word that they are going to do something, but a contract forces them to actually do it. (For example, last summer (2022) CS Admin told us that they would make some meaningful changes to the TA program to address overwork and burnout. They did not. All they did was give CS TAs a small pay raise.)

    Without a contract, we TAs simply have to rely on Brown’s word that they will follow the policies that they set out for us. With a contract, we get to have a real say in those policies, and if Brown or faculty don’t follow those policies (for example, not paying us on time, asking us to work more than required, discriminating against our race or gender or harassing us in any other way, etc.), we can have a legal process to address and fix it. (More on **Filing a Grievance** below.)

</FAQCard>

<FAQCard question="How does bargaining a contract work?">
    Bargaining is a back-and-forth process between TALO and Admin. It goes something like this…

    - TALO presents proposals to admin and admin looks them over and responds with counter proposals, and vice-versa.
    - This process continues until we make a **Tentative Agreement** on a full contract.
    - TALO members will vote on that Tentative Agreement:
        - if a majority of TALO members vote “yes,” the contract is ratified and goes into effect!
        - if a majority of TALO members vote “no,” then we continue the bargaining process.

    A bit Jargony? Yes. Still have questions? Reach out!

    *Special Note: only TALO members will get to vote on the contract ratification. Why? Because CS TAs voted to make TALO the organization that [represents CS TAs in contract negotiations](https://apps.nlrb.gov/link/document.aspx/09031d45839e0cf1). Remember that union recognition election in March 2023? [It was amazing](https://talounion.org/election-info/)!

</FAQCard>

<FAQCard question="How do we win a STRONG contract?">
    Short Answer: Come to the Bargaining Sessions and talk to your fellow TAs!
    
    **Why come to bargaining?** Great question!!
    
    Bargaining is a give-and-take process. We don’t win everything we propose, and neither does admin. BUT if admin sees that TALO members are engaged in the process, admin will see that we can take collective action if we need to. The more we demonstrate that we can take collective action, the more that admin will be forced to compromise.

    **When/where are bargaining sessions?** TALO emails TAs and posts via socials about upcoming sessions when they get scheduled. Through the summer, bargaining will be held via zoom. When bargaining continues in the Fall, we will return to meeting in-person.

</FAQCard>

<FAQCard question="How does TALO develop its contract proposals?">
    TALOs contract proposals are a result of a few things.

    **First**, TAs who are TALO organizers have had hundreds of conversations with TAs about their experiences as CS TAs. These conversations have been translated into some concrete proposals about work requirements, racial and gender equity, and more.

    **Second**, members of the TALO Bargaining Committee met with professionals who have decades of experience writing contracts and bargaining contracts in higher ed. These professionals know things about Brown’s finances and have experience helping unionized workers win strong contracts.

    **Third**, members of the Bargaining Committee did a lot of research about other CS Undergrad TA programs around the country. They looked at rates of pay and the responsibilities for CS TAs at peer institutions, and made wage proposals based on what they found.

</FAQCard>

<FAQCard question="Can any TA bargain the contract?">
    Because CS TAs decided that they wanted TALO to represent them in contract negotiations, only TALO members are legally allowed to bargain with Brown admin.

    TALO is a democratic organization of CS TAs, by CS TAs, for CS TAs. Want to get involved? [insert ‘how to get involved’]

# Contract Proposal FAQ

## Roles and Responsibilities

<FAQCard question="What if I need to do something that’s in the “excluded” section of my position’s responsibilities?">
  The proposed contract specifically avoids restricting what TAs can do and
  instead stipulates what TAs shall not be asked to do. If you want to go above
  and beyond in your job, you can.
</FAQCard>

## Compensation

<FAQCard question="Isn’t $27.50/hr high?">
    Brown does not pay most of its workers a fair wage, including staff and faculty.

    The compensation section of the proposed contract is based on comparisons between our TA program and that of peer institutions, advice from other labor organizations, and input from TAs. In fact, **CS Undergrad TAs at Berkeley get compensated even better than what we’re proposing!** (Which is fair; it’s more expensive to live in the Bay than PVD.)

</FAQCard>

<FAQCard question="What about other undergrad TAs on campus?">
    The Union is actively working with other labor organizations on campus and student workers interested in unionizing to ensure fair compensation and working conditions for all workers at Brown.

    Brown is sensitive to the optics of pay equity; raising wages for CS TAs will provide a lot of leverage for raising the wages of other student workers.

</FAQCard>

<FAQCard question="Can Brown afford the raise we’re asking for?">
    According to a report on Brown’s finances commissioned by the faculty association, the University has over $1 billion in cash reserves, equal to almost 11 months of operating budget. That’s almost twice what is considered “solid” for most institutions.

    The price of attending Brown has grown 25% since 2018.
    The proposed contract advocates for what we need and deserve; Brown will not agree to a raise they can’t afford, and the job of the Union isn’t to figure out Brown’s finances for them. However, we do have a right to know why they can’t afford a proposed raise if they say they can’t. And we have good reason to believe they can afford it.

</FAQCard>

## HTA:UTA:Student Ratios

<FAQCard question="Will higher wages and tighter TA-to-student ratios lead to cuts or enrollment caps?">
    Brown will not agree to a wage raise it cannot afford or ratios that don’t allow courses to function. Brown’s negotiators have indicated that it includes wage equity in its affordability calculations.

    Brown cannot legally reduce the number of TAs working in reaction to the passage of a contract, as this would constitute an unfair labor practice and the Union would file charges with the NLRB.

    Capping courses would be a bad outcome for students if it resulted in reduced accessibility. If this happens, having a Union puts us in a good position to fight it.

</FAQCard>

<FAQCard question="What about courses whose needs aren’t served by the proposed TA to student and HTA to UTA ratios?">
  That said, some courses do have very specific needs, and we’re working with
  the University and department to make sure that our contract doesn’t prevent
  courses from providing good educational experiences.
</FAQCard>

## Grievance Process

<FAQCard question="What’s a “Grievance Process” and why do we need one?">
  A Grievance Process is the formal means by which we can help faculty and admin
  accountable to the contract. If admin or faculty violate something explicitly
  written in the contract, we can file a grievance to force them to correct the
  issue. As an example: if faculty are explicitly sexist in their hiring
  practice, the grievance policy lets us begin a formal means of accountability
  to address and correct the issue. As another example: let’s say a faculty
  demands that you write an assignment on short notice. Not only do you have the
  right to say no, but the grievance policy lets us begin a formal process to
  hold the admin or your faculty supervisor accountable so that they cannot put
  you in that position again.
