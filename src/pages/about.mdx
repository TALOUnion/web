# About TALO

TALO is an organization of CS TAs that fights for the well-being of all CS TAs, with the long-term goal of helping all workers on campus. TALO is a democratic, TA-led organization that only exists because CS TAs decided to create it! Together, we are standing up and fighting for a better workplace.

After winning our election in March 2023, we have been working with the Brown administration on creating our first union contract.

# Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQCard question="How do I get involved with TALO?">
Send a message to talabororg@gmail.com or message us on Instagram @talabororg, and a TALO member will reach back out to you. OR, you can talk to another TA and ask if they know someone involved in organizing! If you ask enough TAs, you’ll find someone who knows someone. This is really the best way, because TALO only works because we talk to each other, prioritizing face-to-face communication.

Want to be _more_ involved? TALO has a few committees:

- an **Organizing Committee**, that leads the work of listening to TAs about working conditions;
- a **Comms Committee**, that spearheads mass messaging via email and social media;
- an **Events Committee**, which is just like it sounds; and
- a **Bargaining Committee**, which leads the work of negotiating our contract (more on that below!)
</FAQCard>

<FAQCard question="How does TALO work? And what is “organizing”?">
  TALO works because CS TAs talk to each other and have conversations about what
  it’s like to be a CS TA: the things you like and want to protect, and the
  things you dislike and want to change. Organizing is the work of talking to
  one another in a structured way. If we as CS TAs all stay connected with one
  another, we have a much stronger chance to affect decisions that impact us as
  TAs. If we stay organized and communicate with one another. TALO holds regular
  meetings and town halls each semester, but TALO works best when we have 1:1
  conversations, where we can better understand the issues that are affecting us
  as TAs.

<FAQCard question="I’m a CS TA this semester. Am I automatically in TALO?">
  Great question! TALO fights for a union contract that applies to all CS TAs
  who work each semester. But that doesn’t mean you’re automatically a member.
  To become a member, sign a membership card! We will have digital cards soon,
  and until then, send a message to talabororg@gmail.com or message us on
  Instagram @talabororg.

<FAQCard question="Why should I be a member of TALO?">
  TALO is an organization of CS TAs for CS TAs. As a union, Brown is legally
  obligated to listen to our demands and negotiate a contract with us. If TALO
  didn’t exist, Brown would make all of the decisions about how the TA program
  is run. But with TALO, we can have a say at the bargaining table about our
  pay, work hours and responsibilities, and how our course faculty can treat us.
  Without members, TALO doesn’t exist. Without you, we’re just a bunch of CS
  TAs. But with you, we’re a Union that fights for our collective well-being.

<FAQCard question="Why else should I be a member of TALO?">
Short Answer: Democracy.

TALO is a democratic organization. Committees do the majority of organization’s work, and committees are open to all members. Important decisions are made by holding votes among membership and/or committee members. Only members can vote.

<FAQCard question="Dues… What’s that about?">
  Union dues are *super* important! Because TALO is independent from the
  University (we don’t get money from SAO!), we need to fund our organization.
  When we negotiate contracts with Brown admin, we win strong raises. So we take
  a small percent of that raise, and we pool the money so that we can keep on
  fighting. We pay a professional staffer to help us out, we get legal support
  because, to be frank, labor law can be a little complicated, and we also fund
  perks, like food, swag, and events. TALO members pay dues that are 1.65% of
  each paycheck, or about $10 a month, depending on your pay rate and how many
  hours you log. TAs who are working and choose not to be TALO members pay 1.4%,
  because it’s only fair that all TAs who benefit from the things we win in our
  contracts fund organization that fights for those benefits. *Note: if you TA
  for course credit and do not receive a pay-check, you do not pay dues!
</FAQCard>

<FAQCard question="I’m not a TA this semester. Can I still be a member?">
  Absolutely! TALO is open to anyone who has been or plans to be a CS TA. You
  only pay dues during semesters you are actually assigned as a TA to a course.
  Members who are not currently working as TAs must remain in “Good Standing” by
  attending a town hall or membership meeting, working on a committee, or having
  a conversation with an organizer once per semester.

<FAQCard question="I’m an international student. Can I be in TALO or a Union?">
  Yes! In the United States, workers rights are much stronger than all other
  non-citizens rights. So if you work a legal job in the US, you are entitled to
  every protection that comes along with that. That includes the right to join a
  union and organize for better working conditions with your co-workers.

<FAQCard question="I’m on work-study… Is that a problem?">
  Nope! Union membership cannot affect work-study allotment, either federal or
  term-time.
