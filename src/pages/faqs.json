    "question": "Can I get fired as a consequence for unionizing (or signing a union card)? Is there a chance I won’t get re-hired in a future semester?",

    "answer": ["You have the right to organize/form a union, join a union, bargain, and discuss the union with your co-workers without losing your job. If the university attempts to violate this right, GLO will provide legal support to affected students.", 
    
    "Your right to get re-hired by Brown is not legally protected. However, the power in numbers is on our side. We have over 65% of current TAs on board, and ~50% of TAs are re-hired between semesters; with many courses already understaffed, it’s hard to imagine Brown could get by without re-hiring any pro-union TAs. Additionally, TAs run the department’s hiring processes, anyways — if we’re asked to discriminate based on union activity, that’d be grounds for a lawsuit, and even more grounds to make a compelling case in the court of public opinion and put massive public pressure on the University."]

    "question": "What if I’m an international student?",
    "answer": ["(see more at Student Workers of Columbia)", 
    "International students have the same rights as US citizens to participate in union activity. Visa requirements in no way compromise your right to belong to a union that represents you in a US workplace. It is illegal for Brown to retaliate against any worker for protected activity, and union efforts fall into that protected category. Thousands of international student workers across the United States are members of labor unions at colleges like the University of California system, Columbia University, and more, and have been otherwise active in their unions for more than 40 years. The international members of Columbia University’s graduate students’ union even have their own working group! That’s not to mention the international graduate students who are a part of GLO at Brown who haven’t had their visas threatened by the University on the grounds of their union activity.",
    
    "All student employees, regardless of their immigration status, have the federally-protected rights to 1) engage in activity with their co-workers concerning their working conditions, 2) form a union, and 3) collectively bargain with their universities. It is illegal for an employer to retaliate against any student employees for exercising their rights under the National Labor Relations Act. If anything, international students face particular vulnerabilities that can be best addressed through a union, such as the protections of a grievance procedure.",
    
    "The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) cannot ask you questions about your union membership or participation in lawful union activity. In addition, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recognized the importance of enforcing labor laws and signed an agreement with the Department of Labor (DOL) that states it is essential to ensure proper wages and working conditions for all covered workers regardless of immigration status. It is your right to belong to a union and being a union member cannot and should not affect your visa application.",

    "Political activities such as picketing, rallies, leafleting, demonstrations, etc., are forms of expression and free association, which are protected for foreigners in the U.S. (including foreign students with visas) as they are for U.S. nationals. It is against the law for your employer (the university) to retaliate against you for participating in these protected activities.",

    "All foreign students enjoy the same rights to freedom of expression and freedom of association as U.S. nationals. Federal law protects your right to join a union. The only relevant restriction on political activity by foreign students is that they cannot make financial contributions to political organizations in the United States."]
