## What will the union do for me? How will my life change once we’re unionized?
- Bargaining power, with the full legal support of a union behind you!
- Democratic decision-making about your contract, which can help with a variety of things, e.g.:
  - Higher pay
  - Fair work responsibilities and reasonable hours
  - Navigating power dynamics with your professor
- Solidarity with thousands of fellow union members at Brown (in GLO and TALO)
- Support from the union with understanding work policies as presented to you by Brown: how they align with national, state, and industry standards, and the law.
- Legal protection from unjust firings, unfair labor practices
  - Unions have lawyers (funded by union dues that all members pay) that will litigate on behalf of workers when needed


## Can I get fired as a consequence for unionizing (or signing a union card)? Is there a chance I won’t get re-hired in a future semester?
- You have the right to organize/form a union, join a union, bargain, and discuss the union with your co-workers without losing your job. If the university attempts to violate this right, GLO will provide legal support to affected students.
- Your right to get re-hired by Brown is not legally protected. However, the power in numbers is on our side. We have over 65% of current TAs on board, and ~50% of TAs are re-hired between semesters; with many courses already understaffed, it’s hard to imagine Brown could get by without re-hiring any pro-union TAs. Additionally, TAs run the department’s hiring processes, anyways — if we’re asked to discriminate based on union activity, that’d be grounds for a lawsuit, and even more grounds to make a compelling case in the court of public opinion and put massive public pressure on the University.

## What is anonymous to my employer and what isn't?
- Union authorization cards are never shared with the employer. If admin agrees to voluntarily recognize the union, the cards will be checked by a neutral third party, and if we need to file for a union election, they will be sent to the National Labor Relations Board, an agency of the federal government. They will never be seen by supervisors or the administration.
- How you vote in a union election is anonymous.


## Will I lose my work-study allotment if I’m a part of a student workers’ union?
- No. Your work-study allotment, federal or term-time, cannot be affected.
- See more about [Columbia University’s student labor union](https://www.studentworkersofcolumbia.com/about-our-union), which includes graduate and undergraduate students. Union representation does not affect students’ work-study status. 

## Will I need to worry about union dues?
- Nobody pays dues until our first union contract is ratified by a majority of TAs.
- Dues will be equivalent to ~1.6% of your paycheck. This will fund the support you’ll receive from professional organizers and the union team with collective bargaining, campaigns, legal protection, and more as needed, throughout your time as a union member.
- When Brown recognizes our union, we will collectively bargain a new union contract subject to an approval vote of all union members. - This contract will include a wage increase that will be AT LEAST the cost of dues (and we’ll fight for much more!). There’s NO UNIVERSE where you’ll be earning less with a union.
- Again: this contract ought to include wage increases to cover the cost of dues; if it doesn’t, as a union member, you can and should vote it down!

## What if I’m an international student?

(see more at [Student Workers of Columbia](https://www.studentworkersofcolumbia.com/frequently-asked-questions))

International students have the same rights as US citizens to participate in union activity. Visa requirements in no way compromise your right to belong to a union that represents you in a US workplace. It is illegal for Brown to retaliate against any worker for protected activity, and union efforts fall into that protected category. Thousands of international student workers across the United States are members of labor unions at colleges like the University of California system, Columbia University, and more, and have been otherwise active in their unions for more than 40 years. The international members of Columbia University’s graduate students’ union even have their own working group! That’s not to mention the international graduate students who are a part of GLO at Brown who haven’t had their visas threatened by the University on the grounds of their union activity.

All student employees, regardless of their immigration status, have the federally-protected rights to 1) engage in activity with their co-workers concerning their working conditions, 2) form a union, and 3) collectively bargain with their universities. It is illegal for an employer to retaliate against any student employees for exercising their rights under the National Labor Relations Act. If anything, international students face particular vulnerabilities that can be best addressed through a union, such as the protections of a grievance procedure.

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) cannot ask you questions about your union membership or participation in lawful union activity. In addition, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recognized the importance of enforcing labor laws and signed an agreement with the Department of Labor (DOL) that states it is essential to ensure proper wages and working conditions for all covered workers regardless of immigration status. It is your right to belong to a union and being a union member cannot and should not affect your visa application.

Political activities such as picketing, rallies, leafleting, demonstrations, etc., are forms of expression and free association, which are protected for foreigners in the U.S. (including foreign students with visas) as they are for U.S. nationals. It is against the law for your employer (the university) to retaliate against you for participating in these protected activities.

All foreign students enjoy the same rights to freedom of expression and freedom of association as U.S. nationals. Federal law protects your right to join a union. The only relevant restriction on political activity by foreign students is that they cannot make financial contributions to political organizations in the United States.

## What’s wrong with internal channels to create change, like speaking with our professors, department leadership, or UCS? Why do we need to be so extreme?

- There is not currently an avenue for TAs to voice their concerns and represent themselves without facing potential employer backlash or increased tensions in their workplace/within their staff. 
- While MTAs do their best to advocate for TAs, they are ultimately a small staff of 2-4 undergraduates themselves, and shouldn’t shoulder the burden of advocating for a large group of diverse TAs.  
- There is a breadth of issues that TA workers face, and a union provides workers with the legal means to tackle all the issues they face at the same time, not just issues related to pay.
- While UCS representatives speak frequently with administrators, UCS representatives often do not have any power beyond an advisory role to administrators. Beyond bringing issues up and advocating for them on the committees, UCS cannot compel administrators to do anything. By contrast, a union legally compels administrators to bargain with us.
- While our professors are sometimes sympathetic to our issues, they ultimately do not have enough control over systemic factors to make significant changes to the conditions of our work. But often, they are not sympathetic at all. 


## Will being in a union and signing a new contract make our work more rigid? Does it mean we will be held to a higher standard?
No! There is nothing in the structure of a union that prevents union members from talking to their supervisors as they normally would. In fact, it is your supervisors who must understand that they can no longer talk to you with disrespect, gaslight you, ignore your problems, or threaten your job security in any way.

As to the standards of your job, what is defined in the contract is ultimately decided by the workers — so the TAs will get to decide what kind of standards they should be held to!

The idea that a union contract, which is collectively bargained by the workers, will somehow create standards that most workers cannot meet, is absurd and nonsensical.

## Will a student workers’ union mean the University needs to give less money to other good causes?
- The university is able to spend more of its endowment than it currently does on pro-student, pro-worker, pro-community investments.
- Brown’s endowment as of October 2022 was $6.5 billion. This massive sum increased by ~51.5% during 2021, meaning that our endowment returns have been immense. The University CAN afford paying students a living wage AND support financial aid fully at the same time. Don’t let them get away with the myth of scarcity!
- Forming this union will lay the material, organizing, and legal groundwork for expanding unionization across all sectors of workers on campus. 

## Why just CS TAs right now? Why not all TAs, or all undergraduate student workers?
TALO grew out of discussions between CS TAs about our working conditions, and with the CS TA program being the system of undergraduate student employment most familiar to us as well as the largest and most visible TA program at Brown, we decided to start with just CS TAs. 

An important part of a unionization effort is defining the "bargaining unit" — a group of employees with a clear and identifiable community of interests — in order to get the union recognized (voluntarily, by the employer, or more commonly, via an election facilitated by the National Labor Relations Board). We believe that the undergraduate TAs employed by the CS department form a bargaining unit on our own, since our community is large and has particular facets to the TA role that are different from other departments. If at this stage we were to declare our bargaining unit to be CS TAs as well as PHYS TAs and NEUR TAs, for instance, Brown would likely challenge our efforts and force us to include all TAs in our bargaining unit. They'd likely say that CS, PHYS, and NEUR TAs aren't too different from ENGN TAs, or TAPS TAs, or APMA TAs, and so on, so all TAs should be included in the bargaining unit. This would complicate our efforts to organize our workforce because we have limited resources, and ultimately we're a grassroots campaign led by undergraduate CS TAs

However, forming this union will lay the material, organizing, and legal groundwork for expanding unionization across all sectors of student workers on campus. We can and will share our campaign infrastructure with other undergraduate workers on campus. In the future, we can incorporate other smaller bargaining units of undergraduate TAs (e.g., PHYS TAs) into our bargaining unit, and TALO can grow to become more representative of all undergraduate TAs at Brown.
