## Will I need to worry about union dues?
- Nobody pays dues until our first union contract is ratified by a majority of TAs.
- Dues will be equivalent to ~1.6% of your paycheck. This will fund the support you’ll receive from professional organizers and the union team with collective bargaining, campaigns, legal protection, and more as needed, throughout your time as a union member.
- When Brown recognizes our union, we will collectively bargain a new union contract subject to an approval vote of all union members. - This contract will include a wage increase that will be AT LEAST the cost of dues (and we’ll fight for much more!). There’s NO UNIVERSE where you’ll be earning less with a union.
- Again: this contract ought to include wage increases to cover the cost of dues; if it doesn’t, as a union member, you can and should vote it down!

## What if I’m an international student?

(see more at [Student Workers of Columbia](https://www.studentworkersofcolumbia.com/frequently-asked-questions))

International students have the same rights as US citizens to participate in union activity. Visa requirements in no way compromise your right to belong to a union that represents you in a US workplace. It is illegal for Brown to retaliate against any worker for protected activity, and union efforts fall into that protected category. Thousands of international student workers across the United States are members of labor unions at colleges like the University of California system, Columbia University, and more, and have been otherwise active in their unions for more than 40 years. The international members of Columbia University’s graduate students’ union even have their own working group! That’s not to mention the international graduate students who are a part of GLO at Brown who haven’t had their visas threatened by the University on the grounds of their union activity.

All student employees, regardless of their immigration status, have the federally-protected rights to 1) engage in activity with their co-workers concerning their working conditions, 2) form a union, and 3) collectively bargain with their universities. It is illegal for an employer to retaliate against any student employees for exercising their rights under the National Labor Relations Act. If anything, international students face particular vulnerabilities that can be best addressed through a union, such as the protections of a grievance procedure.

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) cannot ask you questions about your union membership or participation in lawful union activity. In addition, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recognized the importance of enforcing labor laws and signed an agreement with the Department of Labor (DOL) that states it is essential to ensure proper wages and working conditions for all covered workers regardless of immigration status. It is your right to belong to a union and being a union member cannot and should not affect your visa application.

Political activities such as picketing, rallies, leafleting, demonstrations, etc., are forms of expression and free association, which are protected for foreigners in the U.S. (including foreign students with visas) as they are for U.S. nationals. It is against the law for your employer (the university) to retaliate against you for participating in these protected activities.

All foreign students enjoy the same rights to freedom of expression and freedom of association as U.S. nationals. Federal law protects your right to join a union. The only relevant restriction on political activity by foreign students is that they cannot make financial contributions to political organizations in the United States.

## What’s wrong with internal channels to create change, like speaking with our professors, department leadership, or UCS? Why do we need to be so extreme?

- There is not currently an avenue for TAs to voice their concerns and represent themselves without facing potential employer backlash or increased tensions in their workplace/within their staff. 
- While MTAs do their best to advocate for TAs, they are ultimately a small staff of 2-4 undergraduates themselves, and shouldn’t shoulder the burden of advocating for a large group of diverse TAs.  
- There is a breadth of issues that TA workers face, and a union provides workers with the legal means to tackle all the issues they face at the same time, not just issues related to pay.
- While UCS representatives speak frequently with administrators, UCS representatives often do not have any power beyond an advisory role to administrators. Beyond bringing issues up and advocating for them on the committees, UCS cannot compel administrators to do anything. By contrast, a union legally compels administrators to bargain with us.
- While our professors are sometimes sympathetic to our issues, they ultimately do not have enough control over systemic factors to make significant changes to the conditions of our work. But often, they are not sympathetic at all.
