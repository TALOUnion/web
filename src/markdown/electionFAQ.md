## Who is eligible to vote? 
All Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 CS TAs can vote!

## Can international students vote? 
Yes!

## Can I vote if I'm studying abroad? 
No. Unfortunately, you must be physically present to vote. 

## Is there email or mail-in voting? 
No. You must be physically present to vote. 

## Do I have to be there the entire time? 
No. You have come to the 4th floor of the SciLi at whichever time works between 
12-3PM or 5-8PM, and leave when you are done voting. 

## What does the process look like? 
An agent will find your name on the list of eligible voters, then give you a 
ballot. You privately mark yes or no, and you're done!

## What if I'm still not sure if I can vote? 
If you're not sure, still come and vote! If your name is not on the NRLB list 
of eligble voters and you want to vote, you'll be issued a challenge ballot. 
You'll mark your ballot yes or no and seal it in an envolope. Later, our lawyers
and Brown's will deliberate over the eligibility of each challenge ballot while 
counting votes. 

## Why does the ballot say I'm represented by the Graduate Labor Organization (GLO)?
We are unionizing with GLO, the grad worker union on campus. We will have a separate contract and bargain with Brown independently. Unionizing with GLO gives us access to more resources and helps ensure the union stays strong despite turnover of undergrads and TAs.

## When will we know the results? 
The vote count will occur the night of March 2. We should know the results later
that night.
